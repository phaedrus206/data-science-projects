## Description 
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the worlds most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016. This project looks at the data and seeks to answer questions like
1) Which sex and which country is the most commonly represented? 
2) Average age at which one gets the Nobel Prize?
